                    learn how to play the
                    guitar and relax at the beach. Here is our promise: the skills learned and memories made at Camp

                    hire aspiring coaches who are not only looking to positively impact the campers, but also
                    who are hoping to cultivate their own teaching skills. Our Wildwood Coaching Guide lays the
                    framework for how team sports are taught at camp. We will help train you as you train the
                    boys.
