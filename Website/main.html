            <h1>THE WILDWOOD WAY</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Every boy at Camp Wildwood is unique and that should be celebrated. We have created an
                environment that
                allows boys to choose their own path while being encouraged to appreciate new experiences and different
                perspectives.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Our individualized program is the perfect place for aspiring athletes, entrepreneurs,
                comedians,
                doctors, actors, politicians and more. Boys come together from all over the world to take risks and
                trust each other using our Bunk, Group, Camp model. Wildwood Campers have something in common, they
                found their place in the tightly woven community we have created at Camp Wildwood. The Wildwood Way
                stays with campers far beyond their Senior year at camp. They are a part of Wildwood Forever.

            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Since being founded by Leo Mayer in 1953, Camp Wildwood has been owned and operated by former campers
                including Louis, Teddy and Obie. We know every boy at Camp Wildwood and we spend each day with them at
                meals and activities. Each night, one of the directors visits the bunks to check in on the boys. Our
                hands-on approach makes us accessible to every member of our community. The relationships built through
                Wildwood continue to develop and mature beyond the summers spent at camp.
